WIP, this is still not done, it is full of bugs

nh doujin / galleries scrapper for python3+
write a list of the numbah for the ones you want and it will download them in a 'sauce' folder
something like:
xxxxx1
xxxxx3
xxxxx9
etc

why like this > just put the numbers you want in an excel and copy paste in a file

This scrapper is very manual so it will only work on the current version of the site date: "26march2020"
